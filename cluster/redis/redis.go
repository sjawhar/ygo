// Package redis is a Redis-backed implementation of cluster.Relay, intended
// for multi-process ygo deployments where two or more websocket.Server
// instances behind a load balancer need to share one logical document per
// room (#62).
//
// # Model
//
// One Redis pub/sub channel per room (default name format
// "ygo:cluster:<room>"). Each node subscribes to the channels for its active
// rooms via RoomActivated and unsubscribes via RoomDeactivated, so a node
// only receives traffic for rooms it actually hosts. Publish encodes the
// Outbound (prefixed with this node's stable nodeID) and PUBLISHes it on the
// room's channel; the subscriber goroutine on every node decodes the inbound
// and — for non-self payloads — hands it to Sink.Inject, which the websocket
// provider applies with the relay sentinel origin so the local observer drops
// the echo.
//
// # Self-delivery
//
// Redis pub/sub mirrors every publish back to the publisher's own
// subscription. The wire format carries a per-relay nodeID; the subscriber
// drops payloads whose nodeID matches its own, so the local node never pays
// the decode + Inject + observer round trip for its own writes.
//
// # Delivery guarantee — at-most-once
//
// Redis pub/sub is fire-and-forget and AT-MOST-ONCE by Redis's own definition:
// if a subscriber cannot handle a message — an error, a network blip, or Redis
// disconnecting a subscriber whose output buffer overflowed — the message is
// forever lost. That is a property of the transport, not of this adapter: no
// amount of client-side buffering can make pub/sub lossless.
//
// A lost update is worse than one missing edit. Updates carry causal
// dependencies, so a dropped update parks every LATER edit from that client on
// the receiving node — the apply reports no error, the node simply stops
// converging for that client. The versioned persistence layer
// (provider/persistence) heals this only when the room is next RELOADED, and a
// hot room (always at least one connected client) is never reloaded. ygo's idle
// residency (#183) deliberately keeps rooms resident longer, which lengthens
// that window rather than shortening it.
//
// What this adapter DOES guarantee, since #187: Sink.Inject for one room never
// waits behind another room's Inject call — each room is delivered by its own
// worker, off the shared subscriber goroutine. That worker goroutine isolation
// is not quite total: the shared subscriber goroutine still hands each message
// to its room's lane via Lane.Push, and once a room's queued backlog is over
// cap, Push collapses it synchronously via crdt.MergeUpdatesV1 before the
// subscriber can read the next message — so a wedged room's merge attempts can
// still delay delivery to every other room for as long as the merge takes:
// bounded and amortized while merges keep succeeding, unbounded (one merge
// attempt per message) while they keep failing. That degenerate case is the
// same one that produces HardDrops, so it is already the unhealthy path Stats
// exists to surface.
//
// A saturated room coalesces its KindSync backlog rather than dropping it;
// KindAwareness is keep-latest, so a saturated lane replaces (never drops) the
// queued awareness blob, counted in AwarenessSuperseded, not HardDrops.
//
// Watch Relay.Stats: Coalesced and AwarenessSuperseded going non-zero is
// routine on a busy room (they increment on every ordinary drain merge / superseded
// heartbeat, far below cap, not only on over-cap collapse) — alert on their
// RATE trending up, not their mere presence. RouterDrops going non-zero is
// also routine, expected under ordinary room churn (a message for a room this
// node no longer hosts arriving after RoomDeactivated) — alert on its rate
// too. HardDrops is the one field that should always be zero — alert on its
// presence: it means data was lost and nodes may be diverged.
//
// Deployments that cannot tolerate at-most-once need a durable, replayable
// transport (Redis Streams, or a log like NATS JetStream) rather than pub/sub.
// A late-joining node gets no replay here: it must load head state from
// persistence first and only then rely on the relay for increments.
//
// # Echo guard
//
// The relay package contract is "Origin is observer-local and never crosses
// the wire" (see cluster/relay.go); this adapter honours that. Inbound
// payloads are handed to Sink.Inject which the websocket provider applies
// with its own per-server sentinel; the local observer then drops the
// re-publish via pointer-identity. The self-delivery skip above is the
// adapter's own first-line defence, but the sentinel guard is the
// authoritative one.

	// Transport selects the delivery mechanism. The zero value is PubSub,

	// PubSub remains supported, not deprecated: PUBLISH costs nothing, while
	// XADD is a write with replication, AOF/RDB and memory proportional to

	//
	// Both publishes to and reads from both, for migration; no deduplication is

	//
	// Not just a Redis-efficiency knob: a blocked XREAD cannot be interrupted

// computation below, not just the map snapshot — an earlier version of this
// method unlocked before summing the live lanes, which left a genuine
// three-call race: (1) this method snapshots the map (including live worker
// w) and reads retired, then unlocks; (2) stopWorker runs, folding w's
// current stats into retired and removing w from the map; (3) a stale
// router reference to that same w (obtained from workerForInbound just
// before step 2 — the residual gap described above) pushes more data onto
// it; (4) this method, still holding only its stale slice and no lock, reads
// w.lane.Stats() through that reference and picks up the step-3 push,
// returning a total that includes it; (5) a later call, with w now gone
// from the map, returns retired alone — smaller than what step 4 returned,
// a real decrease. Holding workersMu across the whole loop below closes
// this: stopWorker cannot run between this method's retired-read and its
// per-lane reads, so every value it sums is one a later call, seeded from
// the resulting retired total, can only match or exceed. The remaining gap
// (a step-3-style push landing AFTER stopWorker's own fold, once this
// method is no longer involved at all) is the residual undercount described
// above — invisible to every call from then on, but never a decrease
// relative to one that already ran. The cost of holding the lock this long
// is that Stats() briefly blocks worker creation (workerFor) and retirement
// (stopWorker) for the duration of the loop — acceptable because Stats() is
// a polled diagnostic and each Lane.Stats() call is lock-free (three atomic
// loads — see relaylane.Lane's doc), so it cannot itself block on anything:
// not Sink.Inject, not Redis I/O, and — this matters specifically because
// workersMu is held across the call — not on a concurrent Push/TakeSync's
// own crdt.MergeUpdatesV1 either. An earlier version of Lane.Stats() DID
// take the lane's own mutex, which could have blocked this loop on some
// OTHER room's in-flight merge while workersMu was held, transitively
// stalling workerFor/stopWorker for every room's worker for that merge's
// duration — the same cross-room coupling #187 exists to remove, just
// reached from the stats-polling side instead of the delivery side. Making
// Lane.Stats() atomic-only (done for provider/websocket's identical
// RelayStats() nesting — see relaylane.Lane's doc) closes this for both
// sides at once, since they share the one Lane implementation.
