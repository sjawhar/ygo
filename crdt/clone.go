// Clone returns a new Doc holding an independent copy of this document's
// state, built by copying the structures themselves: no update is encoded, no
// bytes are parsed, and no struct is integrated. It is the copy
//
//	nd := New(opts...)
//	ApplyUpdateV1(nd, EncodeStateAsUpdateV1(d, nil), nil)
//
// makes, for a caller that wants a document to write to and not a wire
// message. opts are New's options and nothing is taken from the source
// document: a clone of a document built with WithGC(false),
// WithFormatCleanup(false), WithMaxPendingItems or a scan bound keeps those
// settings only when the same options are passed here, exactly as the
// encode-and-apply copy above keeps them only when they are passed to New.
// If that client ID already has structs in the copied state, the clone takes
// a fresh client ID, as the encode-and-apply copy does.
//
// Clone takes the document's read lock for as long as it copies, so other
// readers may read the source meanwhile; the source is not written to. Like
// every other method that takes that lock, it must not be called from inside
// a Transact callback, which holds the write lock. Clone the document before
// the transaction, or from another goroutine.
//
// # What the clone holds
//
// Copied, as new objects the source does not share:
//
//   - Every struct of every client - items, the GC structs a wire GC
//     placeholder leaves parented to nothing, and split halves - in
//     per-client clock order, with its ID, delete flag, deferred parent ID and
//     undo redone link, and with every link between structs repointed at the
//     copy: left, right, origin, right origin, parent, parent key, the move
//     that claimed it, and each type's start, key map ("itemMap"), container
//     item and length. The copy is then brought into the applied form, the
//     form an apply of the source's encoding leaves (see below): a run of
//     same-client text structs is squashed into one, and a struct whose
//     parent an update cannot name is collected.
//   - Every struct's content, as Content.Copy makes it: a new content object
//     holding the same values, with a nested type (ContentType) copied as this
//     document copies a type rather than as the empty type Content.Copy makes
//     for a re-insert.
//   - The delete state, which structs carry themselves (Item.Deleted) and
//     which DeleteSetFromDoc and an encode derive from them.
//   - The pending queue: the parked structs, the per-client clocks they wait
//     on, the parked delete ranges with their count and the clients a struct
//     has reached since the last retry, and the deferred moves whose target
//     has not arrived. The queue's clock cover is a cache and is rebuilt on
//     demand rather than copied.
//   - The named root types (Doc.share), each as the class the source holds, so
//     GetText, GetMap, GetArray and GetXmlFragment on the clone return the
//     clone's own type, with the same name, length, formatting flags and
//     (for an XML element) node name. A root the source never opened by name
//     stays the internal placeholder it is there, and the clone's first
//     GetText/GetMap/... upgrades it exactly as the source's would.
//
// Shared with the source, because ygo never writes through them:
//
//   - Strings. A Go string is immutable, and every content that holds one
//     (ContentString.Str, ContentFormat.Key, a type's name) is replaced
//     wholesale, never written into (transaction.go's mergeRuns.finish
//     assigns a newly built string; splitUTF16 returns new ones).
//   - The ID a struct's origin, right origin, deferred parent and redone link
//     point at. Nothing assigns through such a pointer: integrate, split and
//     merge all install a new *ID. (A move's target ID is not shared, since
//     ContentMove.Copy duplicates it.)
//   - A map key pointer (Item.ParentSub). strPtr makes a fresh pointer per
//     key and nothing assigns through one; parentSubEqual and parentSubKey
//     read the value.
//   - The values inside ContentAny, ContentJSON, ContentEmbed and
//     ContentFormat. The slice holding them is copied (Content.Copy), the
//     values in it are not: ygo stores what the caller passed and never
//     writes into it, as Item split and merge already share these values
//     between two items of one document. The one in-place widening of decoded
//     values, jsonNumbers, runs on values that are not yet stored.
//
// Not copied:
//
//   - Observers and subscriptions: OnUpdate, OnAfterTransaction, OnSubdocs,
//     per-type Observe and ObserveDeep. The clone fires nothing until
//     something observes it.
//   - Update logs (OpenUpdateLog), undo managers, and transaction state. The
//     clone has no open transaction and no undo history.
//   - Caches, which the clone rebuilds as it is used: search markers, the
//     first-live-item memo, the YText attribute cache, and the insert hint.
//     None of them is document state; a document with a cold cache answers
//     every query as one with a warm cache does.
//   - Awareness, which is not document state at all (package awareness keeps
//     it outside the Doc).
//   - The item that embeds the source as a subdocument of another document:
//     a clone is a root document, as the encode-and-apply copy is, and can be
//     embedded into one document of the caller's choosing.
//   - The content of a subdocument, which no update of the containing
//     document carries either. A ContentDoc is copied as the V1 decoder
//     builds one (newSubdocFromOpts): a new empty Doc with the source
//     subdocument's guid, gc flag, auto-load flag and meta, and shouldLoad
//     derived from auto-load. A live subdocument is attached and registered
//     in the clone, inheriting the clone's collection ID as an apply does.
//     Clone a subdocument's own state by cloning the subdocument.
//
// # The applied form
//
// EncodeStateAsUpdateV1 of a clone is byte-identical to EncodeStateAsUpdateV1
// of the encode-and-apply copy of the same document, which is what a caller
// replacing that copy with a clone needs. Two things an apply does to the
// structs it reads, a copy of the structures has to do as well, and Clone
// does them with the same code the apply runs, over the copied structs:
//
//   - It squashes a run of same-client text structs that one transaction
//     created into one struct (squashRuns). An apply of a whole state creates
//     every struct in one transaction, so it squashes every run the document
//     holds, while the document those bytes came from squashed only each
//     transaction's own: a text typed one character per transaction holds one
//     struct per character and its copy holds one per run.
//   - It collects a struct whose parent an update cannot name
//     (dropUnnameableParents): an update names a nested type by the id of the
//     container struct holding it, and once that container is deleted and
//     collected, the type is gone from the document the bytes build.
//
// Both change tombstones and struct boundaries, never what a document reads.
// A clone of a document that has neither - most documents, and every document
// loaded from an update - holds its source's structs one for one, and encodes
// as the source as well.
//
// A clone keeps one thing the encode-and-apply copy loses: the content of a
// deleted struct that the source still holds. A document with an UndoManager
// attached runs no auto-GC, so it keeps that content to undo with; the apply
// that builds the copy has no UndoManager and collects the deletion at
// commit, while a clone, which needs no UndoManager of its own to copy the
// content, keeps it. The clone and the copy read the same and hold the same
// delete set; their encodings differ in the collected content alone. With no
// UndoManager attached - every other document - the source has collected it
// already and clone and copy are byte-identical.
