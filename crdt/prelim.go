package crdt

// Every internal piece for locally-created nested types already existed:
// ContentType, abstractType.detached(), the prelimFlusher contract, and the
// generic ContentType branch in item.integrate that links the child and
// flushes its staged content. What it lacked was a way for code OUTSIDE the
// package to build a detached type (abstractType is unexported) and a way to
// insert one into a YArray as its own item (Insert batches plain values into
// a single ContentAny).
//
// Together with the ContentType branch in YMap.Get and the detached staging
// in YMap.Set, this is what a nested document shape needs: for example a
// Jupyter notebook cell, which is a Y.Map holding a Y.Text.

// A note on locking, because it is easy to trip over: Doc.GetArray and
// Doc.GetMap take the document lock, and Transact already holds it. Resolve the
// container BEFORE opening the transaction:
//
//	root := doc.GetArray("cells")          // outside
//	doc.Transact(func(txn *Transaction) {
//		cell := NewMapPrelim()
//		src := NewTextPrelim()
//		src.Insert(txn, 0, "hello", nil)
//		cell.Set(txn, "source", src)
//		root.PushType(txn, cell)
//	})
//
// Accessors that read shared state (Keys, Has, ToJSON) are likewise not safe
// from inside a Transact callback.

// YMap and YArray STAGE their content while detached, as Yjs does with
// _prelimContent: mutations edit the staged content and the net result
// materialises once, at attach. So a key set twice emits once, a key set then
// deleted emits nothing, and consecutive pushes coalesce into a single item —
// a multi-call build emits what Yjs emits, and reads (Len, Get, Keys, ToJSON)
// report the staged content before attach.
//
// YText is the exception, and deliberately so: Yjs stages Y.Text as deferred
// operations (_pending) rather than as content, so YText buffers calls and
// replays them at attach. Its detached reads are empty until then.

// NewTextPrelim returns a DETACHED YText. Mutations are buffered until it is
// attached (via YMap.Set or YArray.PushType) and replayed then, so its items
// get clocks above the container item's — the ordering genuine Yjs produces.
