// right origin, over a seed of four characters. It is the longest chain of
// dependencies a document of that many structs can hold, and the walk has to
// place its structs in the order the chain runs, which is the reverse of the
// order the encoder writes the clients in.

// pass took a pass per link, which is what made a room's answer to a
// browser's SyncStep1 take minutes of CPU.
//
// The bound is on the readiness checks the walk makes rather than on the
// clock, because the count is the same on every machine. A struct is checked
// once for the placement that takes it, and once more for each visit that
// leaves it where it is: the first visit of its client, and one per
// dependency it waits through, of which blocker names four: six a struct at
// worst, and two for this shape (8,001 checks for 4,001 structs). Eight
// leaves room above that ceiling. The walk this replaces checked a client
// per pass and took a pass per link: 8,006,001 checks for the same update,
// 250 times the bound, splitting it in 958ms where it now takes 26ms.
