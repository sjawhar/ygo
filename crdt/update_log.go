// LoggedUpdate is one committed transaction's update, what it parked, and its

//
// Update is the V1 update the transaction's OnUpdate observers are handed,
// the very slice. Like Yjs's update event, it leaves out structs and
// deletions the transaction parked because they wait for something the
// document lacks. Parked is a V1 update of those, nil when the transaction
// parked nothing. A transaction that parked something and changed nothing is
// logged too, with the empty update OnUpdate would be handed, though OnUpdate
// is not called for it. A reader that keeps a copy of the document applies
// Update and then Parked; one that only follows what integrated reads Update
// alone.

// UpdateLog holds a document's committed transactions' updates in the order
// the transactions committed.
//
// OnUpdate cannot give that order. Observers run after the transaction
// releases the document lock (see Transact), so the observers of two
// transactions that commit close together, on different goroutines, can run
// in either order: an observer that renders or classifies each update against
// a replica cannot tell whether a later commit's observer has already caught
// the replica up. An UpdateLog is appended to under the document lock, so
// each observer that drains it finds every update committed so far, in commit
// order, its own included.
//
// The log grows until it is drained: a reader that opens one must Drain it
// (typically from an OnUpdate observer) or Close it.
//
// An UpdateLog is safe for concurrent use.

// before any observer of that transaction runs: an observer that drains the
// log finds its own transaction's update there, after every update committed
// before it, whatever order the observers of concurrent transactions run in.
// A transaction is logged exactly when OnUpdate observers are called for it,
// panicking transactions included, with the very bytes those observers
// receive, and what it parked beside them (LoggedUpdate); and also when it
// parked something and changed nothing, so the log holds every struct and
// deletion an apply kept. A transaction that changes nothing and parks
// nothing is not logged, as OnUpdate is not called for it.
//
// The first transaction to commit after the log opens also records d's
// whole state as of just before that transaction: a V1 update, what
// EncodeStateAsUpdateV1(d, nil) would return at that moment, parked structs
// and deletions included. It is captured under d's lock before the
// transaction's fn runs, so a reader that applies that base and then each
// logged update's Update and Parked in order holds d as it stood after each
// commit in turn, including what d holds parked: a replica rebuilt from the
// log integrates a parked struct when its missing predecessor arrives, as d
// does. A document that never commits after the log opens records no base.
