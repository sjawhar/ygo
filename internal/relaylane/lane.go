// Package relaylane provides the bounded per-room work queue shared by the
// cluster relay's inbound (cluster/redis subscriber) and outbound
// (provider/websocket publisher) delivery paths.
//
// # Why a lane per room
//
// Before #187 both directions funnelled every room through one goroutine, so
// one slow room stalled delivery for all of them. A Lane per room removes that
// coupling: producers hand off without blocking and each room's worker drains
// its own lane.
//
// # Full-lane policy: coalesce, never drop or block
//
// KindSync payloads are V1 update blobs, which are idempotent, commutative and
// mergeable. When the sync queue exceeds its cap the whole backlog is merged
// into a single blob via crdt.MergeUpdatesV1, freeing capacity without losing
// an edit. That is the only policy that is simultaneously lossless, bounded,
// and non-blocking — blocking the producer is the very bug #187 reports, and
// dropping diverges the cluster (a dropped update parks every later edit from
// that client until the room is reloaded, which a hot room never is).
//
// KindAwareness blobs are NOT mergeable and are kept latest-only. Awareness is
// idempotent heartbeat state, so a superseded entry self-heals within one
// heartbeat interval.

// Lane is a bounded work queue for one room. Safe for concurrent use: one

//
// The degraded-path counters (coalesced/awarenessSuperseded/hardDrops) are
// plain atomics, deliberately NOT guarded by mu, even though every site that
// mutates them already holds mu for other reasons (the queue mutations they
// accompany). This is load-bearing: Stats() must be callable by a caller
// already holding some OTHER lock (see provider/websocket's
// Server.RelayStats() and cluster/redis's Relay.Stats(), both of which hold
// a server-level map lock across every live lane's Stats() call to
// guarantee monotonicity) without that call ever blocking on mu — Push and
// TakeSync both hold mu across a potentially slow crdt.MergeUpdatesV1 call,
// so a mutex-guarded Stats() could stall behind an in-flight merge on some
// OTHER room's lane while the caller holds its own lock, reintroducing
// exactly the cross-room coupling #187 removed (a slow room's merge would
// then transitively stall a stats poll for every room, since the map lock
// blocks new readers behind any pending writer). Atomics make Stats() lock-
// free: it cannot block on anything, ever, regardless of what any lane's
// Push/TakeSync is doing. Cross-field tearing between the three counters in
// one Stats() call is immaterial: nothing needs a single instant's
// consistent triple, only each field's own monotonic non-decrease.
