// Package persistence provides a versioned, append-only store for ygo CRDT
// documents, keyed by room name. Each committed transaction's incremental V1
// update is appended as a distinct Version; the head state can be loaded,
// rebuilt at any past version, snapshotted by name, and pruned.
//
// # Internal format
//
// Everything is stored in lib0 V1 (the format produced by
// crdt.EncodeStateAsUpdateV1 and consumed by crdt.ApplyUpdateV1). V1 is the
// only format ygo can merge (crdt.MergeUpdatesV1 has no V2 sibling). Callers
// that need V2 at the edge convert with crdt.UpdateV1ToV2 / UpdateV2ToV1.
//
// # Versions
//
// A Version is a per-room sequence number assigned by AppendUpdate, starting at
// 1. Within an unbroken history versions are dense and increasing; PruneAfter
// resets the head to its target and subsequent appends continue at target+1, so
// version numbers above a pruned point are superseded and reused for the new
// history. Named snapshots carry their own captured version independently.
// ListVersions returns the single (non-cumulative) updates newest-first;
// MaterializeAt folds the updates up to and including a version into a head
// state via MergeUpdatesV1.
//
// # Crash safety
//
// PruneAfter implements snapshot-before-delete: it first persists a rolled-back
// head plus a checkpoint at the target version, and only then deletes the
// updates newer than the target. A crash between those steps must never
// resurrect a "future" version on reopen — implementations enforce the
// checkpoint as a hard ceiling on the visible version range.
