// Both auth-rejection detectors live on the READ path: the PermissionDenied
// data frame and the 4401 close code. But the client writes the Auth token and
// then IMMEDIATELY writes SyncStep1 without waiting for a reply. If the server's
// rejection and close win that race, the SyncStep1 WRITE fails, the read loop is
// never entered, and the failure surfaces as an ordinary retryable I/O error —
// so runReconnectLoop backs off and dials again with a token already rejected.
//
// The rejection is not actually lost when that happens: a probe confirmed that
// data the peer sent before hard-closing stays readable even after the local
// write fails with EPIPE. The client was simply discarding it by returning
// early. This test pins that it no longer does.
