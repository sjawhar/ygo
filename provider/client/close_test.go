// goroutine — which owns runReconnectLoop/runLoop, and is therefore the
// sole writer of this Client's socket (see loop.go's single-writer
// invariant) — has actually finished.
//
// # What this asserts, and why (fixed after a CI flake under -race)
//
// An earlier version of this test closed a channel from a statement placed
// immediately AFTER the `go func() { c.Connect(ctx) }()` call's own body —
// i.e. on the goroutine the test itself spawned, not on anything Connect or
// Close controls — and then checked that channel with a non-blocking
// select run from the main goroutine right after Close returned. That
// reasoning has a gap: sync.WaitGroup.Done (which Connect calls via defer,
// and which is exactly what Close's connectWG.Wait() blocks on — see
// Close's doc, step 1) unblocks the WAITER the instant the count reaches
// zero; it does not wait for the goroutine that called Done to take even
// one more step. So there is a real window, between Connect's defer firing
// and that same goroutine being rescheduled to reach the next statement,
// during which the main goroutine can legitimately finish Close() and run
// the following select before the spawned goroutine's own close() has
// executed. That is scheduling latency on a goroutine the test doesn't
// control, not a broken invariant — and it is exactly the kind of gap the
// race detector's altered scheduling is prone to widening enough to hit,
// which is what made this flake CI-visible on both Go 1.23 and 1.26 while
// passing reliably without -race.
//
// The fix is to assert on a signal Connect's own goroutine produces WHILE
// still inside the window connectWG.Wait() blocks on, rather than on a
// further statement that only runs AFTER Connect has already returned to
// its caller. Connect's own doc establishes exactly such a signal: the
// clean StateDisconnected{Err: nil} bookend it emits via c.emitStatus is
// called strictly before Connect returns and therefore strictly before its
// deferred connectWG.Done() fires (see Connect's doc, and the ordering
// finding — final whole-branch review, Important A — that pinned this down
// after a prior bug let a similar emission slip outside that window). A
// subscriber registered before Connect starts (so it cannot miss the
// emission — OnStatus does not replay, see statusWaiter's doc for the same
// concern) is therefore guaranteed to have already observed that status by
// the time Close's connectWG.Wait() can possibly return, which is itself a
// precondition for Close returning at all (Close's doc, step 1). Observing
// it after Close returns is production-controlled proof that Connect's own

// The bug this guards against: nothing stops an application goroutine from
// calling doc.Transact (or Awareness().SetLocalState) concurrently with
// Close tearing down. Under the OLD order (drain, then unsubscribe), such a
// call could land a payload on the lane via the still-live observer STRICTLY
// AFTER the one and only drain Close ever performs — leaving it permanently
// stuck, uncounted, and silently unreachable once Close returns. Swapping
// the order closes this structurally: by the time the drain runs, the
// observer is already gone, so nothing new can land on the lane through it
// from that point on.
//
// withClosePreDrainHook fires at the exact point between the two steps (see
// closePreDrainHook's one call site inside Close) and simulates the race
// directly, by calling doc.Transact from inside the hook, rather than trying
// to win a real goroutine race on a schedule this test does not control.
// Under the fixed order, the observer is already unsubscribed by the time
// the hook runs, so this Transact call must be a complete no-op for the
// store — proving unsub happens before the drain, not merely usually.
//
// # Mutation-derived RED
//
// This ordering bug has no OTHER way to produce a naturally-failing test:
// reproducing it for real needs an actual concurrent race with an
// unpredictable, machine-dependent window, and a test that depended on
// winning that race would be exactly the kind of flake this package already
// has a documented history of (see the review that prompted this test).
// Verified instead by temporarily reverting Close's step order (moving
// unsubObserver/unsubAwareness back to AFTER dropLaneRemainder+
// closePreDrainHook, matching the pre-review code) and re-running this
// test: it failed, because the hook's doc.Transact call reached the
// still-live observer and wrote an extra row to the store before
// dropLaneRemainder ran, and the assertion below caught it. See this task's

//
// The server here accepts the WebSocket upgrade and then never calls a

// pattern) — so whatever this client sends sits unread, giving the client's
// own writes genuine TCP backpressure to push against. closeDrainTimeout is
// overridden to an ALREADY-ELAPSED deadline so the WRITE failure itself is
// deterministic: net.Conn's contract guarantees a write against a deadline

// # A deterministic write failure is not the same as a deterministic test (#165 Task 10 review, Minor 4)

// <-ctx.Done() case — and Go does not guarantee which ready case a select
// picks. Removing the isClosing() check that used to accompany that version
// (see git history) made the choice of branch matter for correctness, and
// it flaked (Dropped read 0) roughly 1 run in 100–300 under -count as a
// result. Client.countUndeliverable's rule now decides purely from (payload
// kind, Options.Store), so which branch happens to process this specific
// failure no longer changes the outcome for THIS scenario (Store is nil
// here, so either path counts it) — but depending on that being true, rather
// than pinning it down, is exactly the kind of incidental correctness a
// later, unrelated change to the counting rule could quietly break again
// without this test ever noticing. withCloseDrainHook below removes the race
// outright instead of merely making it harmless: it queues the payload from

// Client.countUndeliverable — rather than from ctx state closes that gap
// structurally: the decision is never deferred to begin with, so there is
// no later point at which it could still turn out wrong.
//
// This calls session.flushLane directly against a real (but never-reading)
