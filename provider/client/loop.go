// const. These frames are always small and sent at most once or twice per

// than a var: nothing needs to tune it independently of
// flushWriteTimeout/closeDrainTimeout below, which cover the payloads that
// actually vary in size and frequency (flushLane's ordinary and close-time
// drains).
const writeTimeout = 10 * time.Second

// flushWriteTimeout and closeDrainTimeout bound EACH INDIVIDUAL WRITE
// flushLane's two call sites make (see runLoop): the ordinary per-signal
// drain while a connection is live, and the drain runLoop's ctx.Done() case
// performs once ctx is already done (Close, or the caller's own ctx being
// cancelled) — see flushLane's "Take-before-write" doc section for the
// #202-style accounting that distinguishes them. closeDrainTimeout is
// deliberately SHORTER: an ordinary send has a whole reconnect cycle to
// eventually succeed if it is merely slow, but a write attempted this late,
// with nothing left to retry it, should fail fast rather than sit on an
// already-doomed socket.
//
// # A per-write bound, not a whole-drain deadline
//
// Neither var caps how long flushLane's OWN for loop can run for. That loop
// keeps draining until BOTH TakeSync and TakeAwareness report the lane
// empty (see flushLane's doc) — it does not stop after one write — and the
// Doc/Awareness observers are still fully live for the entire span of the
// ctx.Done() drain specifically: Close only unsubscribes them in its OWN
// later step, which does not run until THIS drain's caller (runLoop, inside
// Connect) has already returned (see Close's doc for the exact step
// ordering). So an application that keeps editing its Doc from another
// goroutine while Close is tearing down can, in principle, keep feeding
// this exact drain new payloads for as long as it keeps editing —
// closeDrainTimeout bounds how long any ONE of those writes gets, never how
// long the drain as a whole takes to finish draining an actively-fed lane.
// (#165 final whole-branch review, Important H: an earlier version of this
// doc, and of flushLane's own, described this as if it were a whole-drain
// deadline — "Close needs a real bound on how long it can take to return" —
// which is not what either var actually enforces.) In practice this
// terminates promptly anyway, because each write is fast (or fails fast)
// relative to any realistic caller's edit rate, and giveUp (see flushLane)
// stops attempting further writes the moment one fails while ctx is
// already done — not because either timeout caps the loop itself.
//
// Both are vars, not consts — unlike writeTimeout above, a test DOES need to
// shrink closeDrainTimeout independently of the handshake-path writeTimeout:
// see close_test.go's withCloseDrainTimeout, which makes
// TestClient_Close_CountsUndeliveredOutboundAsDropped's wedged-connection
// scenario fail deterministically (a deadline already in the past) rather
// than depend on this machine's socket buffer sizes, exactly the same
// "package-level indirection purely for test determinism" pattern
// backoff.go's randFloat already establishes. flushWriteTimeout has no
// equivalent test override: a test that needs an ordinary-path write to fail
// deterministically calls session.flushLane directly with its own deadline
// argument instead (see TestFlushLane_OrdinaryFailureCountsStorelessSyncImmediately).
// Production code never touches either var directly except through
// flushLane's deadline parameter.

// sizing (observed to vary by roughly an order of magnitude — from
// comfortably-succeeds to blocks-for-the-full-deadline within one machine's
// own 640KB-to-800KB window during this package's own test development), and
// gorilla/websocket caches the FIRST write failure on a connection
// (writeFatal) and short-circuits every later write with that cached error
// forever after — so whichever write happens to overflow first "uses up" the
// only failure this connection will ever produce, making the SECOND write's
// own deadline unobservable. A test-controlled net.Conn sidesteps both

// session is one connection's worth of loop state: the socket, and whatever

// Splitting it out from Client is what lets runReconnectLoop start a fresh
// session per attempt without having to remember which Client fields need
// resetting — a new connection is a new session, by construction.
//
// # Single-writer invariant
//
// The precise rule, because a looser statement of it would be false and the
// difference matters: **the loop goroutine is the only writer of DATA frames**
// (WriteMessage). Control frames may additionally be emitted by the read
// goroutine, and MUST only ever be emitted via conn.WriteControl.
//
// That second clause is not a concession this file makes — gorilla does it
// unprompted, from inside ReadMessage. Its default ping handler answers with a
// pong (conn.go:1161), its default close handler echoes a close frame
// (conn.go:984), and exceeding the read limit sends CloseMessageTooBig
// (conn.go:925). All three run on whichever goroutine is in ReadMessage, i.e.
// this file's read pump. It is safe because WriteControl is the one write
// method gorilla documents as callable concurrently with every other method;
// it takes its own mutex and does not touch the shared write buffer that
// WriteMessage owns.
//
// So: anything added to the read side later must use WriteControl and nothing
// else. In particular, an application-level keepalive built the obvious way —
// SetWriteDeadline followed by WriteMessage, from the read goroutine or a
// timer goroutine — would corrupt the connection by interleaving with a data
// frame the loop is part-way through writing, and would do so intermittently
// and under load rather than in a test. A keepalive belongs either in the
// loop's own select, or as conn.WriteControl(PingMessage, …).
//
// Every method on session that writes a DATA frame (write, and everything
// that calls it) runs on the loop goroutine that runLoop owns. That is not a
// coincidence to preserve case-by-case; it is what this whole file is
// arranged around. session.ping (added for #165 Task 7's keepalive) is the
// one method worth naming as an exception to that sentence rather than a
// silent instance of it: it writes a CONTROL frame via WriteControl, which
// gorilla documents as safe to call from ANY goroutine, concurrently with a
// WriteMessage the loop is part-way through — so nothing would actually
// break if ping ran elsewhere. It runs on the loop goroutine anyway, from a
// ticker case alongside every other select case here, purely so this file
// keeps one simple, auditable story ("every write this session performs
// happens on the loop goroutine") instead of a data/control split that would
// be equally correct but harder to verify at a glance. The other half of the
// arrangement is Client.onDocUpdate: a write that blocks on a slow socket
// must never be reachable from a caller's Transact, so the observer hands
// off to a lane instead of writing.

// completes (see session.onSynced). runLoop itself has no opinion about
// what that callback does — runReconnectLoop is the only caller, and it
// passes its backoff's reset method — but it is the thing that has to
// thread the callback down to where the handshake's completion is actually
// detected, which is inside handleFrame, not here.
//
// runLoop never retries anything itself: reconnect and backoff live one
// layer up, in runReconnectLoop, which is what lets THIS function stay
// "one connection, start to finish" — the shape a reader auditing the
// single-writer invariant below wants, rather than one that also has to
// reason about a retry loop wrapped around it.
//
// # Why the reads happen on a separate goroutine
//
// gorilla/websocket's ReadMessage blocks, and the loop must simultaneously be
// able to notice outbound work appearing on the lane. So a read pump goroutine
// does nothing but ReadMessage and hand frames to the loop over a channel. It
// never touches the Doc or the lane, and it never writes a data frame — though
// gorilla itself may emit control frames from inside its ReadMessage call, via
// the concurrency-safe WriteControl path; see session's doc for the exact
// invariant and for what that forbids a later change from adding here.
//
// # Keepalive (#165 Task 7): ping from the loop, deadline refreshed on the read pump
//
// A half-open connection — the peer vanished without ever sending a FIN or
// RST — never produces a read error on its own; ReadMessage just blocks
// forever, and the reconnect loop above this function never gets a chance to
// run. This is solved with the two gorilla mechanisms designed for exactly
// this, kept on the goroutines their own concurrency contracts require:
//
//   - A ping every Options.PingInterval, sent via session.ping (WriteControl,
//     never write/WriteMessage) from THIS function's own select loop below,
//     alongside a ticker case — not from a separate timer goroutine, and not
//     via SetWriteDeadline+WriteMessage from anywhere, which is precisely the
//     naive keepalive session's doc warns would corrupt the connection by
//     racing the loop's own data writes.
//   - A read deadline of readDeadlineMultiplier * Options.PingInterval, set
//     once below before the read pump starts, and refreshed from two places
//     that both run on the read pump goroutine: the pong handler (for the
//     pong-only case, which never surfaces as a ReadMessage return — see
//     gorilla's SetPongHandler doc) and the pump's own loop body after every
//     successfully read frame (so ordinary sync traffic counts as liveness
//     too, not only pongs — a busy connection that happens to need no pings
//     must not be killed by one anyway). Refreshing the read deadline is a
//     read-side call (conn.SetReadDeadline forwards straight to the
//     underlying net.Conn, which is documented safe for concurrent use with
//     unrelated reads AND writes on other goroutines — unlike
//     conn.SetWriteDeadline, which is an unguarded field gorilla's own
//     WriteMessage reads, see gorilla's conn.go), so doing it from the read
//     pump while the loop goroutine is mid-write is not the hazard
//     SetWriteDeadline from the wrong goroutine would be.
//
// A missed pong therefore does not need its own detection path: the read
// deadline simply expires, ReadMessage returns an error, that error reaches
// readErr below exactly like any other read failure, and runReconnectLoop
// takes over from there. Keepalive's entire job is converting silence into
// that ordinary error; it must not — and does not — grow a second reconnect
// mechanism of its own.

// # Terminal vs retryable (#165 Task 9)
//
// Almost every way runLoop can fail is retryable by construction: a refused
// dial, a dropped connection, a keepalive timeout are all conditions that
// may no longer hold by the next attempt, and backing off before trying
// again is exactly the right response. An auth rejection (ErrAuthRejected,
// from a PermissionDenied reply to Options.Token — see loop.go's handleFrame
// wireMsgAuth case, or from the server's WS close code alone when that reply
// frame never arrives — see this function's readErr case and
// wsCodeUnauthorized's doc) is categorically different: the token that was
// just rejected will be rejected again, and again, forever, because retrying
// changes nothing about it. Folding that into the ordinary retryable path
// would turn a bad credential into an indefinite hammering of the server
// with a request that can never succeed — worse than useless, since it also
// hides the real problem behind an endless StateDisconnected/StateConnecting
// churn instead of surfacing it once, clearly, through Connect's return
// value.
//
// So: the errors.Is check below runs BEFORE bo.next()'s backoff sleep, not
// after — a terminal failure is reported and returned on the very FIRST
// attempt, exactly as newly-observed as any other failure, but without ever
// reaching the code that would retry it. See ErrAuthRejected's own doc for
// the sentinel and the errors.Is-through-wrapping contract callers get, and
// auth_test.go's TestClient_Auth_WrongTokenIsTerminal for the proof that no
// second attempt happens (a would-be retry's OnTokenAuth invocation would be
// directly observable server-side, and isn't).
//
// Each RETRYABLE reconnect re-runs runLoop's full handshake from scratch.
// That re-run is deliberately the ONLY recovery mechanism here: see

// disconnected needs no separate replay path, and reconnect_test.go for the
// end-to-end proof.

//
// bo is a fresh backoff for the lifetime of this one Connect call — a
// Client is single-use (see Connect), so there is exactly one of these
// ever. It resets only when a connection's handshake actually completes
// (via the onSynced callback threaded into runLoop, which fires from
// handleFrame the moment the first SyncStep2 of a connection applies —
// see backoff.reset's own doc for why "handshake succeeded" and not merely
// "dial succeeded" is the bar). A run that fails before ever reaching that

// socket.
//
// The Lane's signal is coalescing (capacity 1), so one wake-up can stand for
// any number of pushes: the drain must continue until both takes report
// empty rather than assuming one signal means one payload. A KindSync backlog
// comes back already merged into a single blob, which is why a burst of local
// edits costs one frame rather than one frame per Transact.
//
// # Take-before-write: safe for KindSync, NOT (yet) proven for awareness
//
// Each iteration TAKES a payload off the lane and only THEN writes it to the
// socket. If that write fails — the ordinary case for the failure this
// function is even capable of reporting, since Take itself cannot fail —
// the payload is already gone from the lane: it is not put back, and
// nothing else in this package retains a copy of it. In isolation that is a
// dropped update.
//
// For a KindSync payload (the TakeSync branch), the REST of the lane being
// left queued when this returns early (the ordinary, ctx-still-live failure
// path below) is NOT a lost opportunity in practice, and the reason is
// load-bearing enough to say plainly rather than leave implicit:
// runReconnectLoop re-runs the full y-protocol handshake on every reconnect
// (see its doc), and that handshake's SyncStep2 is derived from the Doc's
// CURRENT state, not from the lane. Whatever this call did not get to before
// returning is still sitting in the Doc — Transact already applied it before
// onDocUpdate ever pushed it onto the lane — so the next successful
// connection's handshake sends it again, merged into whatever else changed
// meanwhile, with no special-casing required anywhere. This is precisely
// #165's central design point (there is no separate offline-op queue)
// applied to failure recovery as well as to planned disconnection: DO NOT
// "fix" the KindSync case by putting a failed payload back on the lane, or
// by adding a retry queue here — that would be solving an already-solved
// problem, at the cost of a second source of truth for pending writes that
// could disagree with the Doc.
//
// That argument is about the REST of the lane surviving to a future
// connection attempt — a purely structural fact about what this function
// leaves untouched. It says nothing about whether THIS ONE payload, the one
// whose write just failed, should be counted as lost; see countUndeliverable
// for that separate question, and for why it is answered from whether
// Options.Store is configured rather than from whether a future connection
// happens to arrive in time.
//
// For a TakeAwareness payload, the same argument does NOT hold: awareness
// state is not doc state, so it is not part of what SyncStep1/SyncStep2
// exchange, and a dropped awareness blob is not "still sitting" anywhere a
// handshake will look. #165 Task 8 covers MOST of this via awareness's own
// supersedable-state property, not a KindSync-style retry — but only for an
// ACTIVE local state, and that qualifier is load-bearing, not a nicety:
//
//   - a dropped ACTIVE-state announcement (SetLocalState(map) or an ordinary
//     Heartbeat) is superseded within at most one PingInterval by one of two
//     Heartbeat call sites in runLoop: if the write failed because THIS
//     connection is dying (the ordinary case — flushLane's error return ends
//     runLoop), the very next connection's handshake fires Heartbeat() the
//     moment its SyncStep2 applies (see handleFrame), before this Client's
//     local state has any chance to look stale to whoever it just (re)joined;
//     if the connection survives and only this one send failed transiently,
//     the ping ticker's own Heartbeat() call re-announces at most PingInterval
//     later regardless;
//   - a lost payload from a local-state change attempted while fully
//     offline is not covered by either Heartbeat call above — neither runs
//     while there is no live connection to run on. It is instead simply never
//     lost in the first place: onAwarenessUpdate's lane.Push happened
//     synchronously when SetLocalState/Heartbeat was called, independent of
//     connection state (see relaylane's never-blocks contract), so the
//     payload sits in the lane — awaiting a live loop to flush it, same as a
//     TakeSync payload sits in the Doc — until the FIRST connection's
//     flushLane runs, not "the ping ticker eventually resends it";
//   - a dropped REMOVAL (SetLocalState(nil)) is the one gap Heartbeat cannot
//     close: Heartbeat is a documented no-op once the local state is nil
//     (see its doc — "No-op when no local state is set"), so it never
//     re-sends a removal that a failed write lost. If this Client goes on to
//     disconnect for real, the removal is superseded by provider/websocket's
//     own disconnect-triggered synthetic removal (peer.handleDisconnect,
//     encodeAwarenessRemoval) once THAT peer connection is torn down — but if
//     it stays connected doing nothing else afterward, peers keep showing
//     this Client's last-known ACTIVE state until it calls SetLocalState
//     again (active or nil) or actually disconnects. Nothing in this package
//     retries the removal write itself, for the same reason the KindSync
//     paragraph above gives: a retry queue here would be a second, competing
//     source of truth for pending sends.
//
// # #165 Task 10: counting what leaves the lane unwritten
//
// Whatever the reasoning above says about the REST of the lane surviving a
// failure, the ONE payload whose write just failed here needs an honest
// answer to "was that lost?" — and that answer comes from
// Client.countUndeliverable, called for every such payload (both on an
// ordinary failed write, and on every payload drained without an attempt
// once giveUp triggers below), not from ctx or from how long is left before
// Close returns. See countUndeliverable's own doc for the exact rule and for
// why an earlier, ctx-based version of this decision is what #165 Task 10's
// review found broken in two different directions at once (a real
// under-count when Close intervened before a hoped-for reconnect completed,
// and a real over-count of a Store-backed payload that was never actually at
// risk) — both symptoms of asking the wrong question ("will a future
// connection arrive in time?") when a knowable-right-now fact
// (Options.Store's presence) already answers the question that actually
// matters ("will SOMETHING durable still deliver this?").
//
// deadline is the caller's choice specifically so the two call sites in
// runLoop can apply different PER-WRITE budgets: the ordinary case
// (flushWriteTimeout, ctx still live) gets the same generous budget writes
// always had, while the ctx-already-done case (closeDrainTimeout) gets a
// short one, since nothing is waiting to retry a write that fails this late
// and it should fail fast rather than sit on an already-doomed socket. This
// bounds each write, not the loop below as a whole — see closeDrainTimeout's
// own doc for why that distinction matters and is not merely academic.
//
// giveUp — set once a write fails while ctx is already done, and left set for
// the rest of this call — is purely a MECHANICAL optimisation, not an
// accounting decision: once ctx is done and a write has already failed, this
// connection's socket is not going to start working again inside Close's
// remaining budget, so there is nothing to gain from attempting the rest of
// the queued payloads one by one, only more time for Close to spend finding
// that out the same way. Every payload drained under giveUp is still passed
// through countUndeliverable individually, exactly like the write that
// triggered it — giveUp decides whether to ATTEMPT a write, never whether to
// COUNT one.
