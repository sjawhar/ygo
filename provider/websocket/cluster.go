// retires the stale predecessor by closing its done channel — never by
// draining it directly, which would let TWO GOROUTINES drain THE SAME LANE
// concurrently (relayLaneWorker's doc explains why that specific case is
// unwanted: it isn't about double-delivery, which Lane's mutex-guarded Take*
// already rules out, but about not depending on relay implementations
// tolerating concurrent Publish calls sharing one lane's backlog). The
// predecessor's own worker goroutine observes its done close and performs
// its own final drain before exiting, exactly as it would from its own
// stopRelayLane call.
//
// That final drain is this handoff's one accepted overlap: it calls
// relay.Publish(room, ...) for the OLD lane while the brand-new worker
// spawned below can already be calling relay.Publish for the SAME room name
// through the NEW lane — two different lanes, two different goroutines, one
// room string, briefly concurrent. This is safe, not merely tolerated,
// because cluster.Relay's contract imposes no per-room ordering or mutual
// exclusion across Publish calls: KindSync payloads are V1 update blobs,
// which are commutative and idempotent regardless of delivery order, and a
// stale KindAwareness payload arriving after a newer one is dropped by the
// receiving Awareness's own per-client clock gate (see awareness.go's
// ApplyUpdate), not by any ordering guarantee this package provides. An
// earlier version of this comment (and relayLaneWorker's/stopRelayLane's)

// this room's worker parked in a slow Publish — the commit path pays a
// bounded, amortized cost of roughly one merge per DefaultCap pushes, NOT one
// per push — but only while that merge keeps SUCCEEDING. collapseLocked
// leaves the backlog fully intact on a failed merge (it does not clear
// syncQ), so every push after that stays over cap and re-triggers
// collapseLocked again: from push cap+1 onward, a failing merge means one
// full MergeUpdatesV1 attempt PER PUSH, not amortized at all — and this does
// NOT end once the backlog reaches 2*cap; it continues indefinitely, one
// hard-drop per push thereafter, for as long as MergeUpdatesV1 keeps failing
// (see collapseLocked's own doc). This degenerate case requires
// MergeUpdatesV1 itself to be failing repeatedly — the same condition that
// produces HardDrops — so it is already the unhealthy path RelayStats.HardDrops
// exists to surface; the amortized-cost claim above describes the
// healthy, expected case. That cost is real but small and infrequent in the
// healthy case, not a stall; #184 tracks MergeUpdatesV1 itself as a hot path
// worth optimizing, which would directly shrink it further. The alternative —
// capping only on the Take* (consumer) side and never on Push — would trade
// this bounded latency for UNBOUNDED memory growth on a wedged room, which
// is worse.
//
// On a saturated lane the backlog is coalesced (merged), never silently
// dropped: an update lost here is NOT recoverable in general. The old

// and a hot room (always at least one client) is never reloaded — so a

// RelayStats returns a snapshot of outbound relay counters, safe to call
// concurrently — including when no relay is attached (all zeroes) — and
// never touching the Transact commit path (it is a polled diagnostic; see
// the package invariant that nothing on doc.OnUpdate/awareness.OnUpdate may
// gain new work because of this method's existence).
//
// Guarantee: Coalesced/AwarenessSuperseded/HardDrops are MONOTONIC across
// sequential calls (never decrease) but not guaranteed EXACT — mirroring
// cluster/redis's Relay.Stats(), including its accepted gaps. Dropped is
// exact (a single atomic counter) and therefore also monotonic. There are
// TWO distinct sources of undercount, both benign (never an overcount, never
// a decrease relative to any total already returned):
//
//  1. (Narrow race) A straggling Push that lands on a lane by name
//     (relayLaneFor) after stopRelayLane/ensureRelayLane has already folded
//     that lane's counters into s.relayRetired and dropped it from
//     s.relayLanes contributes to the counters of a lane nothing will ever
//     read again.
//
//  2. (ROUTINE, not narrow — happens on every retirement of a lane with a
//     backlog) Both fold sites read l.lane.Stats() BEFORE closing l.done,
//     i.e. before the worker's own final drainRelayLane runs. If more than
//     one KindSync entry is still queued at that moment, the final drain's
//     TakeSync call merges them and increments Coalesced on l itself (see
//     TakeSync's doc) — AFTER the fold already captured l's stats and AFTER
//     l was removed from s.relayLanes, so that increment lands on a lane
//     object nothing will ever read again either. Unlike gap 1, this
//     requires no adversarial timing: any retirement of a lane whose backlog
//     has more than one pending entry hits it. Fixing it would mean folding
//     AFTER the final drain instead of before, which would require this
//     synchronous fold path to wait on the worker's own goroutine — trading
//     stopRelayLane's/ensureRelayLane's current non-blocking teardown for a
//     wait of unbounded-by-relay-latency duration, which is a worse trade
//     than an occasional missed Coalesced count on an already-degraded lane.
//
// Monotonicity requires holding s.relayLanesMu for THIS METHOD'S ENTIRE
// computation, not just the map snapshot — an earlier, narrower-locking
// draft of this method left a genuine three-call race, identical in shape to
// the one cluster/redis's Relay.Stats() doc documents in full: (1) call A
// takes the lock, reads s.relayRetired (say 0, nothing retired yet) and the
// live map (including lane L for room "r"), then releases the lock before
// summing; (2) stopRelayLane(r, L) runs: takes the write lock, folds L's
// current counters (say Coalesced=50) into s.relayRetired (now 50), deletes L
// from the map, releases the lock; (3) call A, now lockless, calls
// L.lane.Stats() through its own stale reference (the Lane object itself is
// still valid Go memory even though it is no longer reachable from
// s.relayLanes) and happens to read 50 there too (nothing pushed more onto it
// in between) — call A returns retired(0, read in step 1) + 50 (from L) = 50,
// which looks fine in isolation; (4) but a LATER call B takes the lock,
// reads s.relayRetired = 50 (already folded) and finds L no longer in the
// map, so it never adds L's contribution again — call B also returns 50, so
// this particular interleaving is not itself a visible decrease. The version
// that IS visible: if step 3's stale L.lane.Stats() read happens BEFORE
// step 2's fold captures a value that is later increased further by a
// straggling Push (see enqueueRelayOutbound's doc for exactly that
// straggler), call A can return a total that already reflects that
// straggler's contribution while a later call B, seeded only from the
// smaller retired snapshot stopRelayLane folded in, returns less — a real
// decrease across sequential calls. Holding s.relayLanesMu across the WHOLE
// computation below closes this: stopRelayLane (which needs the write lock)
// cannot run between this method's retired-read and its per-lane reads, so
// every value this call sums is one that a later call, seeded from the
// resulting retired total, can only match or exceed. Taking only the RLock
// side (not the full write lock) is sufficient: this method never mutates
// s.relayLanes or s.relayRetired, and RWMutex's readers-block-writer
// semantics are all that is required to keep stopRelayLane (write side) from
// interleaving with this method's read side.
//
// Deadlock/stall trace: this method holds s.relayLanesMu (read) for its
// entire computation, including every live lane's l.lane.Stats() call. That
// used to be a genuine problem, not just a deadlock risk: relaylane.Lane's
// Push and TakeSync both hold the LANE's own mutex across a potentially slow
// crdt.MergeUpdatesV1 call (see collapseLocked's doc), so an earlier version
// of Lane.Stats() that also took that mutex could BLOCK this method's RLock
// hold on room A's in-flight merge — and because Go's sync.RWMutex blocks
// new readers behind a pending writer, a concurrent stopRelayLane/
// ensureRelayLane (write side) queuing behind that stall would then also
// block enqueueRelayOutbound's relayLaneFor RLock for EVERY OTHER room,
// reintroducing exactly the cross-room commit-path coupling #187 exists to
// remove — bounded (it resolves once room A's merge finishes) and not a
// deadlock, but real coupling in the surface built to observe the absence of
// coupling. relaylane.Lane.Stats() is now lock-free (three atomic loads, see
// its doc), so this cannot happen: this method's RLock hold is bounded
// purely by "iterate len(s.relayLanes) lanes, one atomic load each", never by
// anything any lane's Push/TakeSync is doing. With that resolved, the actual
// lock-acquisition graph is: this method and stopRelayLane/ensureRelayLane
// (write side, for their retired-fold) are the only holders of
// s.relayLanesMu, and NOTHING they do while holding it can block — reading
// atomics, deleting/inserting a map entry, and (for the write side)
// close(prev.done)/go relayLaneWorker(...) are all outside the lock already.
// relayLaneFor takes s.relayLanesMu alone. Push (the commit-path hot loop),
// the worker's drain (TakeSync/TakeAwareness), and publishRelay take only a
// Lane's own mutex and never s.relayLanesMu. So there is no lock anywhere
// that nests INSIDE another lock anymore except relayLanesMu wrapping a
// non-blocking atomic read — no cycle, hence no deadlock, and no more
// cross-room stall either.
