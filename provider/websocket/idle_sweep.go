// a later time.Now() on return (markIdleIfEmpty). All three make the
// Equal check fail, so the sweeper never evicts a room that became active — it
// evicts on emptiness, never on the stale stamp alone. The inflight guard
// additionally covers the #192 orphan-reap paths (ServeHTTP pre-registration
// failures): a concurrent joiner that has obtained the room via
// getOrCreateRoom but not yet registered its peer holds inflight > 0, which
// blocks eviction even though peers is still 0 and idleSince is still zero
