// CompactableAdapter is an optional extension to PersistenceAdapter. When the

// log into a snapshot, prune old versions) — on room unload, and, when
// Server.CompactEvery > 0, after every N persistence flushes on the
// coalescing path (see Server.CompactEvery's own field doc and
// startPersistenceWorker's doc for why: onFlushed, the call site that counts
// those N flushes, is only reachable from there — the strict
// (coalescing-disabled) path never calls it, so those deployments get
// on-unload compaction only).
//
// Compact is invoked from the room's persistence worker goroutine, serialised
// with StoreUpdate for that room INSTANCE, so implementations need no extra
// locking against that worker's own writes. It is best-effort: a returned
// error (or panic) is logged and does not abort persistence. Retention policy
// (how much history to keep) is the adapter's concern.
//
// That serialisation is per room INSTANCE, not per room NAME — read this if
// your Compact mutates shared state keyed by name. Two sources of overlap:
//
//   - Teardown followed by re-creation. A room's worker can still be in its
//     exit-path Compact while a client reconnects and a brand-new room of the
//     same name starts writing. This window predates #229 (see
//     handleDisconnect's flush-then-evict sequence in peer.go).
//   - A retained *crdt.Doc. Nothing calls doc.Destroy on teardown, so a caller
//     holding the doc — from GetDoc, or from an OnLoadDocument hook — keeps its
//     persistence observer alive, and every later commit is written directly by
//     the committing goroutine (#229; before #229 those commits were silently
//     dropped instead). Those writes are serialised among themselves, but not
//     against a successor room of the same name, and they are unbounded in time.
//
// If your adapter's Compact is not safe against a concurrent StoreUpdate for
// the same room name, serialise inside the adapter. Every store this repo ships
// behind persistence.LegacyAdapter already does, each serialising its writers
// under a single mutex: persistence.MemoryPersistence and
// persistence.FilePersistence do so for every operation, reads included;
// persistence/sqlite's reads (Load, ListVersions, GetUpdate, MaterializeAt)
// are deliberately lock-free instead and consistent by other means (see that
// package's methods.go) — but its Compact and AppendUpdate are both writers
// serialised under its own mutex, which is the property this section
// actually depends on.
//
// On room unload, Compact runs synchronously in the worker's exit path.
// Compact is invoked with context.Background() (it is not cancelled by
// Server.Shutdown), so a slow or hanging Compact delays that room's teardown
// and its worker goroutine can outlive Shutdown's return (Shutdown stops
// waiting when its caller's ctx fires, but the worker keeps running until

// gets a user-facing version history without driving one itself.
//
// The distinction from CompactableAdapter matters: Compact collapses the update
// log (a durability/space concern), while SaveVersion records a version a human
// would want to browse and restore. An adapter typically implements this over
// persistence.SnapshotStore.
//
// Cadence and the anti-churn guarantee: SaveVersion is called from the room's
// persistence worker, at most once per AutoVersionEvery per room, and ONLY when
// the room actually changed since the last version. A quiet room is never
// versioned. This is deliberate: versioning per update is what makes a history
// panel unusable. One final version is also captured on room unload if there
// were changes after the last one, so a session's end state is not lost.
//
// Like Compact, SaveVersion is invoked from the room's persistence worker
// goroutine, serialised with StoreUpdate for that room, so implementations need
// no extra locking against concurrent writes to the same room. It is
// best-effort: a returned error (or panic) is logged and never aborts
// persistence. Retention (how many versions to keep) is the adapter's concern.

// O(document) per flush and O(document²) over a session, which is exactly what
// PersistenceAdapter's own doc warns adapters not to do. Appending costs
// O(update); the O(document) fold is still paid, but only once per
// CompactEvery writes rather than on every one — the O(document) cost is
// divided by CompactEvery, not eliminated.
//
// It compacts ITSELF rather than waiting for Server.CompactEvery, which is off
// by default (see that field's doc) — an adapter that only appended and waited
// to be told would grow without bound for anyone who had not opted in.
//
// Trade, stated plainly: LoadDoc is no longer O(1). It folds whatever records a

// can fold and report while this one is still in flight.

// The bookkeeping is therefore MONOTONE rather than snapshot-and-subtract.
// This call reads the room's appended-count as its mark BEFORE folding, and on
// success advances the room's folded-count to that mark only if it moves it
// forward. Two properties follow, and both are needed:
//
//   - A write appended after this fold began is never forgiven by it, because
//     the mark was read before it. Erasing such a write's contribution is what
//     let the un-folded record count exceed CompactEvery indefinitely once
//     writes stopped — the first round of this bug (PR #230 review), reported
//     against a line that deleted the room's entry unconditionally.
//   - A compaction that finishes late can never retract a later one's
//     progress, because folded only moves forward. Subtracting a snapshot
//     instead reintroduced the same erasure between two overlapping Compact
//     calls — the second round of the same review.
//
// It can still under-forgive in the harmless direction: a write that lands
// late enough to actually be swept into this fold is nonetheless counted
// toward the next one, so the next compaction fires at most one write early.
// That is bounded, and bounded-early is the correct way to be wrong here.
//
// On failure the fold's progress mark is left untouched — the records it could
// not fold are still outstanding — but the automatic trigger BACKS OFF: each
// consecutive failure doubles the number of writes before the next attempt, up
// to 64x the base cadence, and the first success resets it (#239).
//
// Without that, outstanding() stays over the threshold and every subsequent
// write retries the fold, each retry paying a full merge over a log the failed
// retry could not shrink — quadratic total work for a permanently failing
// fold, which is the realistic case here (a record MergeUpdatesV1 cannot fold
// fails identically every time).
//
// The backoff governs only the AUTOMATIC trigger in StoreUpdate. This method

// CompactableAdapter path always attempts the fold, and Server.CompactEvery

	//     shutdownCh gate, so a connection accepted while Shutdown runs can
	//     create a room — or finish loading one — afterwards. Nothing waits on
	//     that room's persistDone, so a commit into it can return from Transact
	//     with the update merely buffered. Callers who need the documented
	//     guarantee must stop accepting connections BEFORE calling Shutdown
	//     (see docs/PERSISTENCE.md). Pre-existing; recorded here because the
	//     join above would otherwise read as covering it.
	//   - Conversely the counter covers EVERY commit, not only the stranded
	//     ones (that breadth is required — see Server.strandedInFlight), so a
	//     sustained writer can hold this wait open until ctx expires even
	//     though nothing is stuck.

	// since shutdownCh closed); whatever the lanes still hold is the final
	// outbound tail.
	//
	// 1. Retire every remaining lane (rooms evicted during the connection
	//    closes above already retired theirs via stopRelayLane; this catches
	//    idle-resident and Apply-created rooms). Each worker sees its done
	//    channel close and performs its usual final drain — under the relay
	//    context, which is STILL LIVE, so the tail is actually published.
	// 2. Join the workers, bounded by ctx: Shutdown does not return while a
	//    relay.Publish is in flight unless the caller's deadline forces it.
	// 3. Cancel the relay context. This stops the relay's per-node inbound
	//    delivery goroutine and unwedges any Publish still blocked past the
	//    caller's deadline — a conforming Relay returns on ctx cancellation,
	//    and every payload a cancelled Publish abandons is counted in
	//    RelayStats().Dropped by publishRelay, so a Shutdown that could not
	//    deliver never reads as lossless. The second join then reaps the
	//    unwedged workers; with ctx already expired it returns immediately,
	//    in which case ctx.Err() below tells the caller the join is
	//    incomplete.
